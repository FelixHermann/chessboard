----------------------------

This program finds a way on a chessboard.
The chessboard's size is infinite.
A field on the board is identified by a 2-tupel of positive integers.
The input of the program are two fields: the starting point and the goal.
The command line argument consists of four numbers:
* x-value of start field
* y-value of start field
* x-value of goal

The output of the program is a list of fields.
The first entry of the list is the starting point and the last entry is the goal.
